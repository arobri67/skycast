## Key React Concepts Used

- **Context API**: Utilized for global state management, handling user location and weather data across components.
- **Hooks**: Leveraged various React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useContext for state management and side effects.
- **Custom Hooks**: Implemented custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across components.
- **Functional Components**: Built the entire application using functional components, embracing the modern React paradigm.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Employed conditional rendering techniques to display different UI elements based on the application state.
- **Props**: Utilized prop passing to share data and functionality between parent and child components.
